People are spending more time in doing online shopping for various products available on the e-commerce platforms.Though it took some time for this to be accepted by the end-users, today we are at a point where the majority of the people love to shop online and through our project we can take this one step further by inclusion of collaboration. With collaborative shopping website people can have the same experience as shopping with friends/family in an actual store. Shopping with friends has been a mainstay of the retail industry since stores were first introduced.In a physical store asking for a buying validation or a recommendation from a friend or family member is easy and friction less. With our website you can chat with your friends / family in a session and get recommendations for your next purchase. At the same time you can buy items within a group and get views on the same using the polling system, You can also suggest the items to others using the suggestion feature.
